All 3 models solved the problem.

As with the previous 3 days only Opus intuitively goes to Context7 to learn about Rhombus while the others struggle and don't use tooling. Today I had to stop both models and tell them to use Context7 to learn about the language before proceeding. Still, Gemini struggled.

GPT 5.1 started stealing other models solutions working on Rhombus - quote: "I'll look at the Day 4 Rhombus implementations for the other models to reuse their Rhombus patterns and data structures for this puzzle.". Also, it got stuck trying to hand-create the input.txt file in the Rhombus folder. I had to stop it and instruct it could simply copy it from the 04 folder if it needed to. Generally a terrible experience with GPT 5.1 that at the end got so stupid it couldn't edit its final result into its solution markdown file.
