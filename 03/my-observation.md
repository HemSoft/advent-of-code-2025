Opus made excellent use of Context7 to quickly master the Rhombus language and correct its syntactical first passissues.

Gemini 3 struggled a lot on the Rhombus syntax and did not look for tooling help like Opus did and I observed 15 back and forth attempts to get the Rhombus syntax correct.

GPT 5.1 struggled on Rhombus syntax a lot too and did not pull in tool help like Opus did. Also, GPT 5.1 started creating temporary python files as part of trying to get Rhombus to work :) Even created the debug file in the python folder which it is not supposed to do - it is to stay inside the language its trying to solve the puzzle for. I had to stop it and course correct it. First saying it is to undo touching anything outside of the rhombus folder, second to use Context7 for learning the Rhombus language before proceeding.

GPT 5.1 misses the Elixir implemenation completely.

GPT 5.1 gets a tricky part of part 2 wrong in its algorithm and as a result implements the wrong solution in all languages but misses the Elixir one completely.

Opus could easily explain what GPT 5.1 did wrong which was fun to observe. Opus report is in solution-report.md
